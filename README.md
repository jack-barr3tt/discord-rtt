# 💾 Setup Guide

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm i` or `yarn`
3. Rename `.env.template` to `.env` and fill in the required fields as described in the comments
4. **Optional:** If you want to see train operators shown as emojis, create a `toc_emojis.json` file in the root directory. This file should be a JSON object where the keys are the TOC codes and the values are the Discord emoji strings. For example:

```json
{
  "SW": "<:south_western_railway:123456789012345678>"
}
```

5. Use `npm run start` or `yarn start` to start the bot!
